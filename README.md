Inspired by Google's "T-Rex Game," Extinction adds a twist to a classic by using enhanced graphics to create a visually appealing game for all audiences. Complimented by a retro console built off of an arduino micrcontroller, it's simple game mechanics and ergonomic design allow users of all ages to enjoy a relaxing experience.

This repo contains the main game file, alongside various header files that contain bitmaps of many of our character and setting elements.
